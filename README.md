## 📌 About This Build

This repository exists **only** to share a preview of the work that had been done before the project was paused.  
It’s meant for **testing, curiosity, and reference purposes**, not for production use.

- **No active development**: this build won’t receive updates or bug fixes from the original developers.
- **Feature set may be incomplete** compared to what was originally planned.

If you’re looking for a **fully working, final product** — this isn’t it.
