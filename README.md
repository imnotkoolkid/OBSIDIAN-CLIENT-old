> ⚠️ **Important:** This is **not** the final version of Obsidian Client.  
> The original project was **dropped midway** and development is currently paused.  
> What you see here is an **incomplete build** — it contains missing features, and unfinished work.
> Despite that, it is **stable**, **working without problems**, and fully **downloadable**.

##  About This Build

This repository exists **only** to share a preview of the work that had been done before the project was paused.  

- **No active development**: this build won’t receive updates or bug fixes from the original developers.
- **Feature set may be incomplete** compared to what was originally planned.

If you’re looking for a **fully working, final product** — this isn’t it.
